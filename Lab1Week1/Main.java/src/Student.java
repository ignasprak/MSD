/* Q.3  Create a Student class to become a a subclass of Person. In addition to name and
 *      gender, student should hold a studentId and courseCode.
 * 
 *      Add a constructor to the Student class that initialises all four instance variables to
 *      values passed in as parameters. (Donâ€™t forget to make use of the constructor from
 *      the Person superclass).
 * 
 *      Add a toString() method to the Student class that prints out the four student
 *      details. Make sure to re-use Person class methods where you can.
